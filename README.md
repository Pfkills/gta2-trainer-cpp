# gta2-trainer-cpp

## DEVELOPMENT BRANCH!
Many things may not work, work too much, work glitchy, crash your game, be updated twice a minute. Believe me, it's better for you not to try to compile and run this. Probably all the features from there will be included in the official release at the master branch so don't worry you miss something.

## Playing with code
If you want to build it on your own, there is VS solution inside so it shouldn't be a problem to compile it.

Before you'll try to compile it for the first time, you have to change some settings though
1. Change the configuration to Release x86
2. Configuration Settings > General > Output directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path
3. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Program <-- Gchange it to the GTA2-trainer.exe path
4. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Working directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path
5. Go to the Visual Studio Command Line
6. Type cd Detours
7. Type nmake
8. Wait ...
9. Done!
