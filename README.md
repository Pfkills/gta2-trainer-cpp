# gta2-trainer-cpp

## Faeatures
So... this is only temponary version and probably will be replaced with LUA trainer with a lot more functions and easier code.
It contains some fun features like cop level controll, weapon hacks, car spawner, car fixer etc.

## Fast install
If you want just to play with it, download and copy content of the "build" directory to your game root folder.
Next, just run (in window mode) gta-trainer.exe instead of gta.exe and you should see trainer window under the GTA2 window.

Oh and i've made it on GTA 11.44, if you've got other version I don't promise it will work :<

## Playing with code
If you want to build it on your own, there is VS solution inside so it shouldn't be a problem to compile it.
Oh and you will probably have to change 3 paths in Project Settings so if you run it, VS will start gta-trainer.exe instead of
trying to run gta2dll.dll but it isn't so hard.

#### REMEMBER TO SELECT Realse x86 SETTINGS IN VS BEFORE CHANGING PATHES AND BUILDING!

## Authors
And of course i shoud give some credits at the end.
I based my project on h0x91b's work so all the fame belongs to him i think...
but you can worship me (masuo aka. izawartka) as well :PP

And if you want to add something more to it, you're free to do it but it would be kind if you would mention us somewhere.
