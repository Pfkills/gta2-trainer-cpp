# gta2-trainer-cpp

## Faeatures
Player ped controlling, Cars spawning n' fixing, Weapons giving, Vocals playing, Important info showing, Non-stop crashing ultimate GTA2 trainer with so many features, I can't list them all!!! (or i'm just too lazy nevermind) 

## Fast install
If you just want to play it, download and copy content of the "build" directory to your game root folder.
Next, just run (in window mode) gta-trainer.exe instead of gta.exe and you should see trainer window under the GTA2 window.

Oh and i've made it on GTA 11.44, if you've got other version I don't promise it will work :<

## Playing with code
If you want to build it on your own, there is VS solution inside so it shouldn't be a problem to compile it.

Before you'll try to compile it for the first time, you have to change some settings though
1. Change configuration to Release x86
2. Configuration Settings > General > Output directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path
3. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Program <-- Gchange it to the GTA2-trainer.exe path
4. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Working directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path

And if you want to add something more to it, you're free to do it but it would be kind if you would mention us somewhere.
